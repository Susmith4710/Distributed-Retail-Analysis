# Distributed Retail Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a **multi-datacenter Cassandra Cluster** and a **real-time Kafka data pipeline** with materialized views to support a highly available and scalable retail data infrastructure. It ensures fault tolerance, efficient load balancing, and real-time monitoring for a globally distributed system.

## Architecture
The system is designed with the following components:

### 1. **Data Storage: Cassandra Cluster**
- **Geographical Distribution**: Nodes are spread across three data centers:
  - Europe DC
  - America DC
  - Asia-Pacific DC
- **Data Replication**: Each piece of data is replicated across multiple nodes in a data center and across data centers to ensure availability and durability.
- **Partitioning**: Cassandra employs **consistent hashing** to distribute data efficiently across nodes, ensuring optimal query performance and load balancing.

### 2. **Data Ingestion: Kafka Pipeline**
- Kafka serves as the real-time data ingestion layer.
- Messages are **partitioned by key** and streamed into Cassandra.
- Ensures smooth load distribution using **Kafkaâ€™s partitioning strategies**.

### 3. **Load Balancing Mechanisms**
- **Kafka**: Balances messages across partitions to optimize throughput.
- **Cassandra Token Ring**: Automatically redistributes data across nodes dynamically, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring fault tolerance.

### 4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- **Prometheus**: Collects real-time metrics from Kafka, Cassandra, and other components.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visualizes system performance and detects load imbalances.
- **Alerting**: Triggers notifications when anomalies occur.

## Data Flow
1. Data is ingested into Kafka and partitioned by key.
2. Kafka streams data to the Cassandra-based data pipeline.
3. Cassandra replicates data across all regions based on the configured replication strategy.
4. Prometheus and Grafana monitor real-time performance.

## Key Benefits
- **Global Scalability**: Efficiently handles distributed data across multiple continents.
- **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**: Data remains accessible even if a node or data center fails.
- **Optimized Query Performance**: Partitioning strategies enhance read/write efficiency.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ensures system stability with automated alerts.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Cassandra** (Distributed NoSQL Database)
- **Apache Kafka** (Real-time Data Streaming)
- **Prometheus** (Monitoring & Metrics Collection)
- **Grafana** (Dashboard & Visualization)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended for local setup)
- Java (For running Kafka)
- Python (For monitoring scripts if required)

### Steps
1. **Set up Cassandra Cluster**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d cassandra
   ```
2. **Start Kafka & Zookeeper**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d zookeeper kafka
   ```
3. **Deploy the Data Pipeline**
   ```sh
   python data_pipeline.py  # or respective script
   ```
4. **Set up Prometheus & Grafana**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana
   ```
5. **Monitor the system** by accessing Grafana dashboards.
